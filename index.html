                                <p>Hey! I'm Jason, a 4th year (this Fall) undergraduate CS/STATS double major studying at UC Berkeley and a Software Engineer in the making. I'll be in graduating in Spring 2019!
                                </p>

                                <p>In my free time, I work on a few personal projects such as a tool to predict NBA players's performance for Daily Fantasy Sports betting and a Google Docs Add-on to help educators and their students highlight Google Docs in the classroom. They're fun to work on, they help myself and others, and they've helped me grow a lot in terms of being a Software Engineer.
                                </p>

                                <p>This summer (2018), I interned at Amazon (Lab126) as a Software Development Engineer intern. It was a great experience to work on the FireOS codebase and push code changes into production and onto customers' Fire tablets.
                                </p>

                                <p>The previous summer (2017), I interned at WePay, a small fintech startup, where I developed tools to help WePay developers automatically generate fully object oriented SDKs for their APIs.</p>

                                <p>Beyond my personal projects and work experience, I study hard at school and work hard to grow.</p>

                                <p>And besides school and work, I play a little Pokemon GO on the side and some Starcraft II to sate my competitive side. (I play Protoss &#9786;)</p>

                                    At Amazon/Lab126, I worked on the FireOS codebase for the upcoming release cycle. Specifically, I worked on SystemUI, which deals with lockscreen, quick actions, wallpaper, and other tablet system related responsibilities, as well as utility apps such as the weather app or camera app.

In addition to these feature implementations, I worked on a variety of bug fixes to improve the customer experience and refactored code to tidy up the massive codebase.

                                    In my 2017 summer, I interned as a Software Engineer Intern at WePay. During my time there, we developed an SDK generator
                                    to automatically generate customizable SDKs for the WePay API in multiple languages.
                                    By developing this tool, we saved WePay engineers time and resources since the SDKs for
                                    each language can be automatically updated upon an API version change instead of having
                                    an engineer painstakingly update each SDK. We also designed and structured the SDK to
                                    provide a user-friendly experience for WePay partners.

                                    all made me a stronger developer and engineer. I'm incredibly grateful to have been given

                                    For the past few years I've been working on this project (predicting NBA players' nightly performance). I've built a lot
                                    of tools to help automate tasks and make my workflow cleaner and more efficient. For

                                    Modeling players' performance with this data was a different beast. I did a lot of exploratory data analysis and trial and
                                    error to figure out which features were the most effective in predicting a player's performance. Then I tried out and ensembled
                                    many models (eventually stuck with XGBoost: gradient boosted trees) to predict their performance. And finally, I utilized
                                    the k-best Knapsack algorithm to optimize for the best lineups each night.

                                    personal project for the Computer Science club but over the past few years it has amassed
                                    over 250,000 users across the world in classrooms. The add-on has been such a success
                                    due to the teachers and users who suggested features they wanted to see implemented and
                                    emailed me about their user experience.

                                    During Spring 2017, a group of students and I tackled the problem of automating the process of recommending research grants
                                    to Berkeley faculty for the Berkeley Research Development Office. It was quite the difficult
                                    problem that put up lots roadblocks for us on the way such as the lack of data on previous
                                    matches (privacy/security concern), the generality of language of research grants, faculty
                                    members not updating their profiles, and so on. In the end, we were able to build a small
                                    web app using Flask to showcase our model and its predictions. Our model utilized a combination
                                    of TFIDF (term frequency inverse document frequency), simple dot products, and word nets
                                    such as GloVE and Word2Vec. I'm really glad I had a team to work on it with since I really
                                    enjoyed arguing and discussing solutions to those roadblocks that I mentioned.

                                    In my first research assistant position, I analyzed and managed my professor's magazine circulation data. To help the data
                                    entry process into Google Spreadsheets, I wrote scripts in Google App Scripts to automate
                                    tasks such as moving images from folders and to validate data. To showcase the data,
                                    I built d3.js visualizations to show the change over time of and the geographic distribution
                                    of magazine sales. And finally to automate the data transfer process to a database without
                                    my professor having to worry too much about the technical side of things, I wrote a Python
                                    script to take data from Google Spreadsheets and transfer it directly to a MySQL database
                                    without having to download any csv files or such. I wanted to make it as easy as possible
                                    for my professor and his colleagues.
